  bio: [
    "I'm an electrical engineer working where energy systems meet intelligent software. My background is in control systems, automation and digitalization: I studied Control Systems and Automation at Universitas Indonesia and wrote my thesis on multi-agent reinforcement learning in a digital twin of industrial IoT edge networks.",
    "Today I work on renewable energy and power systems: power system dynamics, power electronics, distributed energy resources, and the controllers that keep generators, batteries and solar plants stable on the grid.",
    "I'm an AI and digital transformation enthusiast, and I'm most interested in applying AI, machine learning, deep learning and reinforcement learning to intelligent control of energy systems.",
